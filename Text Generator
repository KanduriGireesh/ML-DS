# 🎤 Text Generation using LSTM (Adele Lyrics)

This project demonstrates a character-level RNN (LSTM) that learns patterns in Adele's song lyrics and generates new lines of text based on a given seed input. Built using TensorFlow and Keras.

---

## 📌 Overview

- **Objective:** Generate Adele-style lyrics using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).
- **Approach:** 
  - Collected raw text data from an online lyrics file.
  - Tokenized the text into sequences for model training.
  - Trained an LSTM-based neural network using word embeddings.
  - Used the trained model to generate new sequences of lyrics based on seed text.

## 🧠 Techniques Used

- Text Preprocessing using `Tokenizer` and `pad_sequences`
- Word Embedding Layer
- LSTM-based RNN (Stacked LSTM)
- Dropout for regularization (optional variations included)
- Sequence generation with softmax prediction
- Categorical crossentropy loss

## 🚀 Model Architecture

- Embedding Layer (vocab size × 50)
- LSTM Layer 1 (100 units, returns sequences)
- LSTM Layer 2 (100 units)
- Dense Layer (ReLU, 100 units)
