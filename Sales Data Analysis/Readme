# 📊 Sales Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes a **retail sales dataset** to uncover trends, seasonal patterns, and customer purchase behavior.  
The dataset consists of **11 columns** such as order details, product information, and purchase location.  
Additional attributes (`Month`, `Sales`, `City`, `Hour`) were engineered to support deeper analysis.  

The main goals of this project are:
- To identify **best-selling products** and **top-performing cities**
- To analyze **monthly and hourly sales trends**
- To study the **impact of price on quantity ordered**
- To generate **business insights** that can guide marketing, pricing, and inventory strategies

## 🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis
1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Removed duplicates & missing values  
   - Converted `Order Date` to datetime & extracted `Year`, `Month`, `Day`, `Hour`  
   - Added new feature: **Revenue = Price Each × Quantity Ordered**  
   - Encoded categorical columns (`Product`, `City`)  

2. **Key Analysis**
   - **Monthly Sales Performance** → Peak in **December**, lowest in **January/February**  
   - **Top Products** → Batteries, charging cables, and laptops (by revenue)  
   - **Price vs Quantity** → Negative correlation (expensive products → lower quantity)  
   - **City-wise Sales** → San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York lead in revenue  
   - **Hourly Trends** → Peak orders between **11 AM – 7 PM**
